# 8-1-Assignment-Final-Reflection
Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.
What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
Describe your strengths as a software developer.

The course help me in reaching my professional goals is wanting to be a developer it gave me a better understand of docker compose and the backeend 
of the application works. An the storage of the keys and how that works. The skills I have learned, develpoed, and or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field has made me more knoweledgable. The strength as a software developer is to deteremine the goals of the projects and be able to add new feauters to add a better experience to users. 

Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
The types of roles I am prepared to assume in a new job is now a new developer role. 

Planning for Growth: Synthesize the knowledge you have gathered about cloud services.
Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future. Consider the following:

How would you handle scale and error handling?

I would handle the scale and error handling design by a modular and scalable architecture with performance optimization techniques like caching and asynchronous data fetching. To make sure there is a user friendly messages, monitor and valdating. 

How would you predict the cost?

I would predicted the cost by determing the goal of the project and how much storage. 

What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?
What is more costally is serverless computing is more cost predictable compared to containers. The platforms charge based on the actual usage, executions, and timing. 

Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.

The pros of the plans for expansion is increased market reach to unlock new customers, economies of scale  cost efficiencies through bulk purchasing. The diversification reduces dependecy on the single markets. The cons is the higher costs, operational complexity and market risks. 

What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?

The roles that elasticity in cloud computing allows the resources to scale up or based on demaned that helps with growth. The pay for service align with the costs directly with usage and the planned growth as it provides cost efficency.
